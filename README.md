# Data to Action: Masterclass on Making Smart Decisions

## Overview
This repository documents my participation and submissions for the **"Data to Action: Masterclass on Making Smart Decisions"** hosted by Excelerate. The 3-day masterclass focused on developing a data-driven mindset, equipping participants with practical tools for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and strategic decision-making. Through hands-on tasks, case studies, and a capstone project, I learned to transform raw data into actionable insights for business growth.

The repository is structured into folders for each deliverable and the capstone project, containing my completed tasks, reports, datasets, and visualizations. Each folder includes a dedicated README.md for detailed descriptions of the work.

## Masterclass Structure and Objectives
- **Objective**: Empower professionals to harness data for smart, scalable decisions using tools like Excel, Tableau/Power BI/Looker (though I primarily used Excel and Word for submissions).
- **Key Topics**: Data-driven vs. gut-driven decisions, data cleaning and visualization, strategic frameworks (e.g., SWOT, decision trees), case studies (Airbnb, Zara), and a retail simulation.
- **Gains**: Practical skills in data handling, industry tools, strategic thinking, and problem-solving with real datasets.
