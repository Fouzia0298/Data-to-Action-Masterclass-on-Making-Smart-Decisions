# Data to Action: Masterclass on Making Smart Decisions - Deliverable 2

## Overview
This section of the repository contains my work for **Deliverable 2** of the **"Data to Action: Masterclass on Making Smart Decisions"** hosted by Excelerate. Deliverable 2 focuses on practical data handling skills, including cleaning a raw dataset, creating visualizations from the cleaned data, and summarizing a case study on Zara's use of data in fast fashion. The dataset used is a coffee shop sales dataset (similar to the RetailX example provided in the masterclass), which I cleaned and analyzed to derive insights.

## Deliverable 2: Completion Requirements

### Task 1: Clean a Raw Dataset
**Objective**: Clean a given raw dataset by fixing errors, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data type consistency.

**Description**: I inspected the "Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx - Transactions.csv" dataset for issues such as missing values (none found), data type inconsistencies (converted date and time columns to datetime formats), structural inconsistencies in categorical columns (none significant), and duplicates (none found). The cleaned dataset is available in the Excel file, with the Transactions sheet containing the processed data. A detailed report outlines the cleaning steps and findings.

**Files**: 
- `Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard.xlsx` (Cleaned dataset in the Transactions sheet)
- `Coffee Shop Sales Data Cleaning Report.docx` (Detailed cleaning report)

### Task 2: Create a Data Visualization
**Objective**: Create a simple chart (bar, pie, line) from the cleaned data to visualize key trends.

**Description**: Using the cleaned dataset, I created a comprehensive dashboard in Excel that includes multiple visualizations:
- Bar charts for transactions by hour of the day and by weekdays.
- Line chart for total revenue by month.
- Bar chart for transactions by product category.
The dashboard provides an overview of total revenue ($698,812), total units sold (214,470), and various trends in sales performance.

**File**: `Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard.xlsx` (Visualizations in the Dashboard sheet; Analysis sheet contains supporting pivot tables)

### Task 3: Zara Case Study Summary
**Objective**: Write 3 bullet points on how Zara uses data for fast fashion decisions.

**Description**: This task involved summarizing Zara's data-driven approach in the fast fashion industry. The bullet points highlight real-time monitoring of sales and feedback, rapid adjustments to designs and inventory, and data-informed decisions on restocking and discontinuation.

**File**: `ZARA Case Study.docx`

## Repository Structure
- `Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard.xlsx`: Cleaned dataset, analysis pivots, and dashboard visualizations.
- `Coffee Shop Sales Data Cleaning Report.docx`: Report on data quality issues and cleaning process.
- `ZARA Case Study.docx`: Summary of Zara's data usage in fast fashion.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, analysis (pivot tables), and creating visualizations/dashboard.
- Microsoft Word: For drafting the cleaning report and case study summary.
- Data analysis techniques: Inspection for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies; datetime conversions.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Cleaning Best Practices**: Identified that even seemingly clean datasets require thorough checks for types and structures to enable accurate analysis.
- **Visualization for Insights**: Creating charts and dashboards revealed trends like peak transaction hours (8-10 AM) and top-selling categories (Coffee), aiding in business decision-making.
- **Case Study Application**: Zara's example demonstrated how real-time data enables agility in inventory management and trend responsiveness in fast-paced industries.

## Next Steps
Building on data cleaning and visualization skills, Deliverable 3 will involve strategic tools like SWOT analysis, decision trees, and a data-backed strategy plan, leading to the Capstone Project where I'll apply everything to the RetailX sales data for comprehensive insights and recommendations.
