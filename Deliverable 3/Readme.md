# Data to Action: Masterclass on Making Smart Decisions - Deliverable 3

## Overview
This section of the repository contains my work for **Deliverable 3** of the **"Data to Action: Masterclass on Making Smart Decisions"** hosted by Excelerate. Deliverable 3 emphasizes strategic thinking by applying data to business analysis and decision-making frameworks. It includes creating a SWOT analysis, a decision tree or scenario model, a 1-page data-backed strategy plan, and a final presentation on a simulated business problem.

## Deliverable 3: Completion Requirements

### Task 1: SWOT Analysis
**Objective**: Create a SWOT analysis for a business using data, covering Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

**Description**: I performed a SWOT analysis for "The Daily Grind," a small independent coffee shop. The analysis incorporates data from loyalty programs, foot traffic counters, staff records, HR data, competitor analysis, local surveys, industry studies, and global supply chain trends. Strengths include high customer loyalty (75% weekly visits) and prime location; weaknesses cover lack of online presence and high turnover; opportunities involve expanding districts and ethical sourcing; threats include new competitors and supply disruptions.

### Task 2: Decision Tree or Scenario Model
**Objective**: Create a simple decision tree or scenario model using data to evaluate business decisions.

**Description**: I developed a decision tree for "TechGadget Inc." to assess launching a new smart home device. The model uses probabilities for market adoption (high: 40%, moderate: 40%, low: 20%) and calculates Expected Monetary Values (EMV): $420,000 for launch vs. $100,000 for no launch, recommending launch based on higher EMV.

### Task 3: 1-Page Data-Backed Strategy
**Objective**: Create a 1-page business strategy plan using data, including goal, data used, actions, and outcomes.

**Description**: The strategy focuses on enhancing Customer Lifetime Value for "AuraFit," an online fitness subscription service. Goal: Increase retention by 15% in 6 months. Data from churn analysis (40% churn in first 3 months), feedback surveys (30% cite lack of support), engagement metrics (25% higher retention with coaching), and competitor benchmarking. Actions include proactive onboarding, motivation tracking, and optimizing coaching. Outcomes measured by KPIs like retention rate, churn rate, engagement, CSAT, and NPS.

### Task 4: Final Presentation
**Objective**: Present findings and recommendations based on a simulated business problem using data.

**Description**: The presentation addresses customer churn at AuraFit, summarizing the problem (40% churn), insights from data, strategic goal (15% retention increase), actions (onboarding, motivation boosts, coaching optimization), expected outcomes (loyal subscribers, revenue growth, better reputation), and KPIs. It serves as a visual overview of the data-backed strategy.

## Repository Structure
- `SWOT analysis.pdf`: Includes the SWOT analysis, decision tree, and 1-page strategy.
- `Presentation - Enhancing Customer Lifetime Value A Data-Backed Strategy for AuraFit.pdf`: Slide deck for the final presentation on the AuraFit strategy.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Word/PDF: For documenting SWOT, decision tree, and strategy.
- Presentation software (e.g., PowerPoint exported to PDF): For creating the final slide deck.
- Data sources: Internal metrics, surveys, industry reports, and benchmarking.

## Key Learnings
- **Strategic Frameworks**: Applying SWOT and decision trees with data helps identify actionable insights and quantify risks/rewards.
- **Data Integration**: Using multiple data sources (e.g., churn rates, surveys) strengthens strategy development and recommendations.
- **Presentation Skills**: Structuring findings into a cohesive narrative enhances communication of data-driven decisions.

## Next Steps
This deliverable integrates all prior skills into strategic application. The Capstone Project will apply these to the RetailX sales data for deriving insights, visualizations, and recommendations to boost sales and reduce returns.
